**Super interesting courses I have taken at UC Berkeley:**

**Fall 2023:** 

STAT 204 Probability in Application **Instructor:** Professor Steve Evans (Probability course for people who do not want to be a probabilist.)

STAT 210A Theoretical Statistics **Instructor:** Professor Will Fithian (Well-known 210 series. A lot of homework but good grading.)

EECS 227AT Optimization Models in Engineering **Instructor:** Professor Gireeja Ranade & Venkatachalam Anantharam  A+ (I like optimization.)

**Spring 2024:** 

STAT 210B Theoretical Statistics  **Instructor:** Professor Nikita Zhivotovskiy A+ (I like Nikita's teaching style, making me fall in High-dim.)

STAT C245A Introduction to Modern Biostatistical Theory and Practice **Instructor:** Professor Mark van der Laan & Alan Hubbard A+ (Mark is super smart and I am interested in semi-parametric theory, efficiency theory, and empirical process.)

PBHLTH W252A Introduction to Causal Inference for Public Health Professionals **Instructor:** Professor Laura Balzer A+ (Basic Causal Inference)

**Fall 2024:**  

PBHLTH 243A Targeted Learning **Instructor:** Professor Mark van der Laan (TMLE could do anything except RDD.)

STAT C245B Biostatistical Methods: Survival Analysis and Causality **Instructor:** Professor Mark van der Laan A+ (I always mix this course with Targeted Learning.)

STAT 260 Topics in Probability and Statistics **Instructor:** Professor Nikita Zhivotovskiy A+ (Everyone should learn Mini-max theory and RKHS once.)

**Super helpful reading groups or Seminars I have attended at UC Berkeley:**

**Fall 2023:**  

STAT 298 Neyman Seminar hosted by Professor Ryan Giordano

**Fall 2024:**  

Variational Inference Reading Group hosted by Professor Ryan Giordano & Alexander Strang
