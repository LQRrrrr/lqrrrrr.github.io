<p>
My name is Qiuran (Rita) Lyu. I am a second-year student in the UC Berkeley Biostatistics Division MA/PhD track. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/jingshenwang/" target="_blank">Dr. Jingshen Wang</a></strong>. Before coming to Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate major in Statistics and minor in Fintech from Renmin University of China Statistics department and Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence. In 2022, I was fortunate to be a visiting student at <strong><a href="http://jsb.ucla.edu" target="_blank">JSB lab</a></strong> in UCLA and advised by <strong><a href="http://jsb.ucla.edu/about-jingyi-jessica-li" target="_blank">Dr. Jingyi Jessica Li</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://stat.oregonstate.edu/directory/xinzhou-shawn-ge" target="_blank">Dr. Xinzou Shawn Ge</a></strong> and a visiting student at <strong><a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/" target="_blank">Dr. Jun S. Liu</a></strong>'s lab in Harvard University. From then on, I developed great interest in the junction of Statistics and Artificial Intelligence for Biology & Healthcare tasks.
</p>
<p>
My research interests lie in Causal Inference, Health equity, LLM inference, Computational Biology, and AI for Science & Healthcare. I am currently working on the topic "How to develop a robust metric to have better statistical inference in finetuned (multimodal) LLM, especially for Alzheimer's Disease".
