<p>
My name is Qiuran (Rita) Lyu. I am a second-year UC Berkeley Biostatistics Division MA/PhD track student. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/jingshenwang/" target="_blank">Dr. Jingshen Wang</a></strong>. Before coming to Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate major in Statistics and minor in Fintech from Renmin University of China Statistics Department and Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence. In 2022, I was fortunate to be a visiting student at <strong><a href="http://jsb.ucla.edu" target="_blank">JSB lab</a></strong> in UCLA and advised by <strong><a href="http://jsb.ucla.edu/about-jingyi-jessica-li" target="_blank">Dr. Jingyi Jessica Li</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://stat.oregonstate.edu/directory/xinzhou-shawn-ge" target="_blank">Dr. Xinzou Shawn Ge</a></strong> and a visiting student at <strong><a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/junliu/" target="_blank">Dr. Jun S. Liu</a></strong>'s lab at Harvard University. From then on, I developed a great interest in the junction of Statistics and Artificial Intelligence for Biology & Healthcare tasks.

<p>
My research focuses on developing multimodal large language models tailored for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, employing AI-assisted experimental designs to optimize healthcare interventions, and creating digital twins to simulate patient-specific disease trajectories. Additionally, I am developing rigorous statistical methods to validate and interpret LLM outputs, ensuring trustworthy and interpretable AI-driven results in health science.
